// In C++, a character array is often terminated by a null character ('\0')
// to mark the end of the string. So, when you declare a character array like
// char str[] = "gfg";, it actually includes three characters ('g', 'f', 'g')
// and an additional null character ('\0') to signify the end of the string.
